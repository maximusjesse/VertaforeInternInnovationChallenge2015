##Overview
These are planning ideas for the 2015 Vertafore Intern Innovation Challenge.  This file is located at \\\grande\Personal_Files\JZhao\VertaforeInternInnovationChallenge2015\VertaforeInnovationChallenge.md , I'll regularly sync it to Github so you guys can add your thoughts/ideas.

##Leankit Analytics
##### **Description**
Using Leankit API, we create a dashboard to quickly identify visually the current state of a particular LeanKit board.  This tool would allow board managers to plug-and-play their LeanKit boards to provide quick visualizations that's not provided out of the box by LeanKit flow metrics.  Some example widgets may include:
- Outstanding cards
- Board Congestion
- Analytics on Card Priority (Factoring Card Size, Due Date, Start Date, Assigned Users, etc.)

LeanKit boards are tedious to manage and analyze quickly and efficiently.  A visual dashboard can reduce the feedback time to minutes/seconds and provide critical insights on development progress.


##Vertafore Question/Answers Board
##### **Description**
Allows for a Quora-like Q&A type forum within the organization to help promote communication and innovation.  Users will be able to sign in with their own Vertafore credentials with a profile.  Questions can be tagged with relevant technologies or topics, and can be posted in relevant topics.  In Questions and Answers, users may tag specific users to prompt a response (which would send an email) for further domain expertise.

Ideally, this site could assist in a reoccuring pain of lack of cross-team communication among the organization.  It's never a good idea to reinvent the wheel in our day-to-day technical challenges, and we hope to leverage the talent and expertise of the knowledge base in the Vertafore orgnization.
