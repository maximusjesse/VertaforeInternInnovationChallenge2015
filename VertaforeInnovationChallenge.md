# Vertafore Intern Innovation

Collaboraters: Derek Chi, Amit Mondal, Chao Wu, Jesse Zhao

##Overview
These are planning ideas for the 2015 Vertafore Intern Innovation Challenge.  This file is located at \\grande\Personal_Files\JZhao\VertaforeInternInnovationChallenge2015\VertaforeInnovationChallenge.md , I'll regularly sync it to Github so you guys can add your thoughts/ideas.

###Leankit Analytics
#### **Description**
Using Leankit API, we create a simple dashboard to quickly identify visually the current state of a particular LeanKit board.  Initial dashlets can include:
-Outstanding cards
-Cards by size
-Cards by impact (how many other cards will it affect, how many people?)

#### **Challenges**
-Has to surpass the widgets that are integrateable already in wiki.vertafore.com
-May lack historical cards
-Board layout dependent?

###Vertafore Quora (Working title....)
#### **Description**
Allows for a Quora-like Q&A type forum within the organization to help promote innovation.  But, we already have this... http://botd-devforums.devop.vertafore.com/default.aspx

#### **Challenges**
-We already have a forum that no one uses
-Vertafore is slow to adopt new things...

###Vertaforeddit
#### **Description**
Dumbass idea I had, mainly kept it cause I think it has a funny name.

#### **Challenges**
-Stupid

###Conference Room Manager
#### **Description**
Seriously? It's 2015 and we're using an email system to check conference rooms?  Idk, seems a little archaic to me.  This would be a UI tool to see room avaibility and scheduling.

#### **Challenges**
-Using Outlook's rooms feature is not TOO awful, has to be significantly more convenient for people to adopt change.

###Vertafore Organizational Chart 
#### **Description**
This tool would be an improvement to the existing org chart in MS Sharepoint.  It would better map/graph employees by team/location, as well as include skills/expertise for higher visibility.  Use case would mainly for people to track down other members in the organization to answer domain-specific questions.

#### **Challenges**
-We already have an org chart
-LinkedIn Skills/Fields integration (would be unfeasible to expect people to enter their own skills/projects IMO)
-Get internal organizational data
