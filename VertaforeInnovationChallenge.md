##Overview
Recently, the interns of the organization have been assigned to create a project that falls under the theme "Make Vertafore Better". We would like your feedback on two ideas that we've been considering on implementing. Please give us your honest feedback, and if you would like to see your own idea implemented, please let us know and we'd love to consider it!

This is a competitive assignment from Bothell's University Relations, so we'd love your support as we take on this challenge!  Please give us feedback by taking the [survey](http://goo.gl/forms/3Ptc2RNUgK).

##Leankit Analytics
##### **Description**
Using Leankit API, we create a dashboard to quickly identify visually the current state of a particular LeanKit board.  This tool would allow board managers to plug-and-play their LeanKit boards to provide quick visualizations that's not provided out of the box by LeanKit flow metrics.  Some example widgets may include:
- Outstanding cards
- Board Congestion
- Analytics on Card Priority (Factoring Card Size, Due Date, Start Date, Assigned Users, etc.)
- ...And more!

LeanKit boards are tedious to manage and analyze quickly and efficiently.  A visual dashboard can reduce the feedback time to minutes/seconds and provide critical insights on development progress.

##Vertafore Question/Answers Board
##### **Description**
Allows for a Quora-like Q&A type forum within the organization to help promote communication and innovation.  Users will be able to sign in with their own Vertafore credentials with a profile.  Questions can be tagged with relevant technologies or topics, and can be posted in relevant topics.  In Questions and Answers, users may tag specific users to prompt a response to alert another user for further domain expertise.

Ideally, this site could assist in a reoccuring pain of lack of cross-team communication among the organization.  It's never a good idea to reinvent the wheel in our day-to-day technical challenges, and we hope to leverage the talent and expertise of the knowledge base in the Vertafore organization.
